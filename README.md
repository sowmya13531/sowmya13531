## 💫 **About Me:**  
Hi, I’m Sowmya! I’m a passionate Machine Learning Engineer along with Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning . I love turning complex problems into intelligent solutions and building real-world AI/ML applications that make an impact.  

I have hands-on experience in NLP, Computer Vision, LLM-based applications, and RAG systems. I enjoy working with Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, Streamlit, and FAISS to build end-to-end ML pipelines, chatbots, AI assistants, RAG systems, recommendation systems, and real-time detection systems.  

I believe in learning by building, experimenting, and shipping projects rather than just following tutorials. Currently, I’m diving deep into AI/ML, exploring LLMs, RAG applications, optimizing ML models, and also learning **Full Stack development**.
